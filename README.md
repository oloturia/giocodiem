I started this project when I was 8, now I'm 37 and I completed it.

The project is made of two games. Game one is a nibbler-like game in which you have to avoid walls and your tail (but only if the
colors of the head and the tail are matching), game two is a simple avoid the asterisks game. You can copy this game on a working
ZX Spectrum or try it out on an emulator like FUSE.
